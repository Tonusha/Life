Life 1970.
====
Implemented in javascript as a pet project.
See [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) for more info on this game.

Goals of this project:

* Use TDD
* Use javascript for code and jQuery for animation etc
* Make a beautifully looking, simple featured, full fledge implementation of Life

Features:

* Play/pause button
* Speed slider
* Cells change animation
* Presets with colonies to start with
* Can edit game at any step in paused mode by clicking on the cells

What it is NOT:

* There is no intention to optimise code for large-scale fields.
* This is not a simulator to be used if you love the game. It is a toy for 2 minutes.
